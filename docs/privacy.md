# Privacy Policy

Last updated: March 2026

## Overview

ExtensionChecker is designed with privacy in mind. We collect the minimum data necessary to operate the Service.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your privacy is our priority. We do not collect personal information beyond what is necessary for the Service to function.

## What We Collect

### Submitted Extensions

When you submit an extension for analysis (via URL, ID, or file upload), the Service processes the extension package temporarily in memory to extract and analyze its manifest. We do not permanently store uploaded extension packages.

### Server Logs

Standard server logs may include:

- IP addresses (used for rate limiting)
- Timestamps
- Request paths and response status codes

These logs are retained for a limited period for operational and security purposes only.

### No Cookies or Tracking

The public ExtensionChecker application does not use cookies, analytics trackers, or third-party tracking scripts. Theme preferences are stored in your browser's `localStorage` and never transmitted to our servers.

## What We Do Not Collect

- Personal information (name, email, account details)
- Browser fingerprints
- Usage analytics beyond standard server logs

## Data Processing

All analysis is performed server-side in Cloudflare Workers. Extension data is processed in memory and is not written to persistent storage. Analysis results are returned directly in the HTTP response.

## Self-Hosted Instances

If you self-host ExtensionChecker, you control all data processing. This privacy policy applies only to the public instance at `app.extensionchecker.org`.

## Third-Party Services

The public deployment uses:

- **Cloudflare** — for hosting, CDN, and Workers runtime. Cloudflare's privacy policy applies to infrastructure-level data handling.

## Changes

We may update this policy as the Service evolves. Material changes will be noted in the project's release notes.
